          • Designing an in-house neural network to generate the optimal path
          for the car, based on its location, the presence of other traffic
          elements and their movements around the car as a member of a
          four-person team


          • Implemented and enhanced a neural-network based methodology to
          predict the trajectories of the adjacent vehicles for a self-driving
          car


          • Implemented and integrated a Lidar and camera-based models for
          detecting and tracking objects


          • Devised sections of motion planning algorithm to enable the car to
          incorporate the behaviors of surrounding traffic elements when making
          driving decisions


          • Finetuned networks to classify pedestrian behaviors in urban areas
          to improve the experience in the car when passing near sidewalks
          and/or crosswalks


          • Demonstrated Imagry's self-driving car to clients numerous times
          over the period of last 2 years


          • Assisted in building infrastructure for data collection and training
          deep learning networks


          • Performed benchmark testing in the lab as well as on the autonomous
          car platform and produce documentations

          • Customized deep learning algorithms on GPU to improve image feature
          extraction from ImageNet dataset. Additionally, this improved image
          classification for ‘Visual Question and Answering: VQA’, an image +
          language-based AI application  


          • Improvised algorithms associated with deeper Long Short-Term Memory
          (LSTM) units in TensorFlow to improve the textual feature extraction
          for VQA application 


          • Attained accuracies of 54% and 51% for the VQA task with 25% and 1%
          measurement rates of VQA v1.0 images, respectively 


          • Analysed methodologies to minimize the relative error in predictions
          (predicting dog instead of van, for a cat) for VQA task
